# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to oversample and undersample the credit card dataset from LendingClub. This was to be done using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms for oversampling and the ClusterCentroids algorithms for undersampling. Overall we wish to structure a machine learning model that is capable of predicting credit risk with the highest accuracy.
