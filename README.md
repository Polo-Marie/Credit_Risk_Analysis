# Credit_Risk_Analysis

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to oversample and undersample the credit card dataset from LendingClub. This was to be done using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms for oversampling and the ClusterCentroids algorithms for undersampling. Overall we wish to structure a machine learning model that is capable of predicting credit risk with the highest accuracy.

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results. 
There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)

## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
